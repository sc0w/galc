We were kindly invited by the MATE project to use their transifex ressources 
for galc:

https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/MATE/resource/galc/

For short instruction on how to use transifex, see

http://wiki.mate-desktop.org/translation

So if you are interested in translating galc, please register at 
transifex and provide your translation through transifex. If this is not an
option for you, follow the old instructions below and submit your translations
on sourceforge as patch or feature request.

If there are new strings to translate, run
	intltool-update -p
to update the po/galc.pot file and
	tx push -s
to push the new source file (configure in .tx/config) to transifex.

Before a release, do a 
	tx pull -f -a --minimum-perc=10
to get all translations with a minimum translation count of 10%.

Add all to SVN, and add the resp. language codes to configure.in!

xgettext -f POTFILES.in -k=_ -o package.pot
	creates a new package.pot. please note that file galc.pot exists
	and that you don't need this step therefore. resume with:

msginit -l ll
	with ll language code (e.g. de) sets up ll.po file

edit this ll.po file

this ll.po must be in UTF-8.

make update-po 
	for merging etc. look out for FUZZY entries etc

search at google for "locale id" to look up language codes

no empty newline in POTFILES.in!!!!!

add language code to ../configure.in
